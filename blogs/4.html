        <h1 class="my-4 text-white font-bold text-2xl">Controller API</h1>
        <p>
          Our prof showed us his app that can detect and then print out all of a
          controller's events whenever he pushes a button or used the joystick.
          He briefly showed us the code for his program and tasked us with
          incorporating the controller into our game. It's the midterm week
          coming up and we still hadn't worked on a single line of code together
          for the game, I couldn't help but feel a little bit worried about not
          finishing this game in time.

        <h1 class="my-4 text-white font-bold text-2xl">Team Retrospective</h1>
        <p>
          At the end of the week, the chat team had a sprint retrospective and
          the 'Run game' team evaluated the members of the group. For the chat
          protocol, our group were able to finish most of the important tasks
          for this sprint, the protocol examples are the only ones that got
          pushed back to the backlog for the next sprint. On On the other hand,
          the Run game's team had a little bit of an argument since some of the
          more vocal and active members in the team felt quite unfair that they
          have to carry the workload sometimes since the more reserved members
          are not contributing as much. We collectively decided that everyone
          should take turns and voice their opinion from the next meeting
          onwards.
