        <h1 class="my-4 text-white font-bold text-2xl">Controller API</h1>
        <p>
          Our prof showed us his app that can detect and then print out all of a
          controller's events whenever he pushes a button or used the joystick.
          He briefly showed us the code for his program and tasked us with
          incorporating controller to our game. It's midterm week coming up and
          we still hadn't worked on a single line of code together for the game,
          I couldn't help but feeling a little bit worried about not finishing
          this game in time.

        <h1 class="my-4 text-white font-bold text-2xl">Team Retrospective</h1>
        <p>
          At the end of the week, the chat team had a sprint retrospective and
          the 'Run game' team did an evaluation amongst the members of the
          group. For the chat protocol, our group were able to finished most of
          the important tasks for this sprint, the protocol examples are the
          only ones that got pushed back to the backlog for the next sprint.
