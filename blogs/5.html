        <h1 class="my-4 text-white font-bold text-2xl">Dynamic Library</h1>
        <p>
          It's crucial for our game to be able to load a library at run time, so
          it would be more lightweight and generic. Essentially, in our case,
          the game development team would require an API, in this case the
          function prototypes, from the chat team and then load that in anywhere
          in the game program that requires chat functions. Loading libraries in
          dynamically would allow the application to not have to load everything
          at the startup of the app, which would significantly worsen the
          performance of our game.
        </p>
        <h1 class="my-4 text-white font-bold text-2xl">
          Application Programming Interface (API)
        </h1>
        <p>
          An API would have to be provided to the game dev team so that they
          could implement the chat features. I suppose what the chat team will
          be doing in the coming weeks is to work on documenting the API so that
          it would be easy to implement.
