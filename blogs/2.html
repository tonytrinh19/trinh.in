          Our group had a little meeting to discuss the core mechanics of our
          game and to prepare for the presentation as well. We figured that
          making a game such as Splix would not be ideal on an interface like
          ncurses after 2 hours into the discussion; therefore, we collectively
          decided that it's best to switch our focus to something a little bit
          different. One of our teammate, Giwoun, suggested that we should still
          keep the Capture the flag game mode but remove the territory factor
          that we got from Splix.

          We created the presentation to show it to our guest, a game designer
          and received some constructive criticisms for the game, and some
          directions on pushing the game forward.

          The chat team also had a brief meeting to discuss the protocol of our
          chat feature. Thanks to the brilliant Stirling and the GiJo chat
          protocol, we quickly formed our very first chat protocol document. The
          whole set also redesigned the structure of the our storage system
          since its current state is very unfriendly for newcomers to navigate.
