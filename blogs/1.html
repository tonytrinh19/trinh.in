      <p>Starting something new is always a challenge!</p>
      <h1 class="my-4 text-white font-bold text-2xl">Making the game</h1>
      <p>Our team consists of 16 members from set O BCIT. The goal is to make a finished product that we enjoy developing and others enjoy playing. </p>
      <h1 class="my-4 font-bold text-2xl text-white">Ideation</h1>
      <p>We start by dividing the class into 3 different groups to generate different game ideas. Each team then come up with names, general description about each game, and finally decide the games' screen size, number of players, and game pace.</p>
      <img class="min-h-max min-w-full" src="../imgs/ideation-process.png"></img>
      <p class="text-xs italic text-slate-200 px-8 pt-4 pb-2">A bunch of ideas are created in a mere 30 minutes.</p>
      
      <p>We then pick the best 2 out of all of the ideas. It comes down to the feasibility of the project (ncurses, 3 months period, etc..), and how many are on board with the idea. We again split into 2 teams, each dive deeper into more possibilities and explore the practicality of the 2 games.</p>

      <h1 class="my-4 text-white font-bold text-2xl">It's something</h1>

      <p>Our group focuses on the splix game idea and eventually decide that we're moving forward with this weird combination of <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-bomberman-r-switch/" class="underline hover:text-blue-700">bomberman</a> and <a href="https://splix.io/" class="underline hover:text-blue-700">splix</a> game. Here are some parts of the actual notes that we put down:</p>
      <p> - Attacker/Defender style game</p>
      <p> - Grid style base with random indestructible portions</p>
      <p> - Attacking team will try to capture a flag and return it to their side and is given different weapons to destroy base or eliminate defenders</p>
      <p> - Defenders build base (i.e. lay woods, bricks, metals etc) to protect flag</p>
  
        <p> - Move using arrows keys of WADS
        </p>
  
        <p> - Perform actions using one to two keys (undetermined)
        </p>
  
        <p> - Objects scattered around grid will dispense power-ups
        </p>
        <p> - Inspired by snake or splix combined with bomberman and capture the flag.
        </p>
        <p> - Team based 6 vs. 6
        </p>
        <p> - In terms of networking:
        </p>
        <p> - Many players
        </p>
        <p> - High input
        </p>
        <p> - Potential objectives:a
        </p>
        <p> - Capturing the flag
        </p>
        <p> - Time-limit: how many flags have to been captured
        </p>

      <p class="text-xs italic text-slate-200 px-8 pt-4 pb-2">A prototype made in 20 seconds by combining bomberman's head and <a class="underline hover:text-blue-700" href="https://splix.io/">splix.io</a> using paint</p>
      
      <p>There's obviously a lot of work need to be done but i'm very excited to be a part of this and i can't wait to see the final result.</p>
