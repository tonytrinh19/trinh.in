        <p>
          This week we did some more planning and reviewing. Apparently, we are
          working in 2 teams now because we still hadn't picked which game our
          set would be doing yet. Our set broke out into 2 sets to write SWOT
          analysis for each game. We divide into 3 separate categories: Team,
          Product, and Process and then each member would take turn and put down
          what they think the Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, Threat for each
          category are. We took the team members input and then we tried to come
          up with solutions to overcome Weakness and Threat sections.

        <p>
          Then we had a meeting with the chat team. We fleshed out some more
          ideas for our chat protocol and we also asked D'Arcy for his input and
          the protocol seemed to be on the right track. D'Arcy only suggested
          that we should add Version in the header field because we would
          continuously update our chat protocol to meet the requirements of the
          game and the level of expertise of our set as a whole.

          Jordan created a Jira board since we agreed that we should implement
          agile methodology into our development process. We did poker planning
          to determine the difficulty of each task, then assign appropriate
          members to work on the tasks. Our goal is to crush this protocol by
          the end of next week!
